# Experiment 1 – RGB Channels & Binary Image 🖼️

- A Python-based experiment that allows users to upload an image, visualize its **Red, Green, and Blue channels** separately, and convert it into a **binary (black & white) image** using thresholding.
- Built with **OpenCV** for image manipulation and **Matplotlib** for visualization.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload any image directly from your device.
- **RGB Channel Visualization**: View Red, Green, and Blue channels individually.
- **Binary Image Conversion**: Convert the image to black & white using thresholding.

## Setup

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy google-colab
```
## Usage

- Open DL_Ex1.ipynb in Google Colab.
- Upload an image when prompted.
- Visualize the original image, RGB channels, and binary image results.
